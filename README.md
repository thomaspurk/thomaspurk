# About Me  

I am a software engineer with a problem-solving background and a passion for adopting new technologies. My work involves developing intelligent applications, leveraging NLP technologies, and integrating AI solutions into real-world systems. With experience in deep learning, semantic web technologies, and data science, I focus on building scalable and efficient AI-powered applications.  

I am particularly interested in **Generative AI (GenAI)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning**. My goal is to explore AI's potential for solving complex problems while maintaining a strong foundation in software engineering principles.
